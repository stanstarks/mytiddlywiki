title: Stirling's Formula
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The formula as typically used in applications is
$$
\ln(n!) = n\ln(n) - n +O(\ln(n))
$$
The next term in the O(ln(n)) is (1/2)ln(2Ï€n); a more precise variant of the formula is therefore
$$
n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n
$$
Being an asymptotic formula, Stirling's approximation has the property that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!}{\sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n} = 1.
$$
