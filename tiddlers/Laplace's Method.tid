title: Laplace's Method
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Azevedo-Filho & Shachter 1994 reviews Laplace's method results (univariate and multivariate) and presents a detailed example showing the method used in parameter estimation and probabilistic inference under a Bayesian perspective. Laplace's method is applied to a meta-analysis problem from the medical domain, involving experimental data, and compared to other techniques.
