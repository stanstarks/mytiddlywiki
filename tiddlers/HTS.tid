Installing all dependencies for HTS demo CMU Arctic slt

* HTS 2.2 patch for HTK 3.4.1, installed
* [[Festival]] (festvox): festival requires a bunch of files to download and comes with a dataset
* hts_engine API, installed
* SPTK: requires csh, installed tcsh on Arch machine
* tcl/tk (already up to date)

! Model
$$
P(O|\lambda) = \sum_{Q}P(O,Q|\lambda)
$$
where $O$ is speech parameter vector sequence, $Q$ is state and $\lambda$ is the continuous mixture HMM. The speech parameter vector $o_t$ consists of the static feature vector (e.g. cepstral coefficients) and dynamic feature vectors (delta, delta2 cepstral coefficients) that is $o_t = [c_t, \Delta c_t, \Delta^2c_t]$.

The model is solved by alternating gradient descend.
