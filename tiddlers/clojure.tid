* Figwheel
** Figwheel autoreloads and compiles your clojurescript code so that you can live code and see your changes update in the browser. It also comes with a repl for your clojurescript so you can evaluate your code there. This will come in handy.
* [[Reagent]]
** Reagent wraps the React.js library and provides a neat Clojurescript interface to it. This is my first time using it and itâ€™s been very simple to pick up and use.
* Ring
** Ring is a simple abstraction for HTTP in Clojure. It allows you to create a webserver, define middleware etc.
