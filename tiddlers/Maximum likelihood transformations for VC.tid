! Transform-based
* ''Feature extraction:'' The input speech examples are first analyzed to extract the spectral parameters that represent the speaker identity. Usually these parameters encode the short-term acoustic features, such as the spectrum shape and the formant structure. 
* Train conversion
* Transformation: The new spectral parameters are obtained by applying the trained conversion functions to the source parameters.
* Synthesize speech from the parameters. Mapping the [[prosody]] is an equally important and challenging problem. The souce pitch is shifted and scaled to match the mean and variance of the target speaker.
