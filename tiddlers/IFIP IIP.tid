!! Background
[[Neuromorphic Cognitive Computing]]

Karlheinz Meier - Neuromorphic Computing beyond von Neumann

Cons of von Neumann:

# Uniform
# No separation of memory and computing
# Not programmed
# No established theory (in brain science?)

Firing patterns represents the action potential

Mimic this activity in microscopic level

Biology Cell Level Simulation

# 10,000 reconstructed neurons
# 2 mWalt:100 Walt
# 1000 times slower

Timing problem is foundamental: e.g. simulating brain envolvement within 15yrs

!! Definition
Neuromorphic computing simulates neurons with silicon substrates. And it can solve time and energy issues (?)

# massive parallel
# configurability
# asnchronous communication

# SpiNNaker: 18 ARM 6 inter chip connections
# IBM Almaden: 45nm processors, real programming model for AI problems
# 10,000 faster than biology: 50mil synapses
# real time approach analog cells (Boahen, stanford)
# Qualcomm Neural Processing Units

!! Interests

# Cell properties
## Cell firing patterns, synchronisations, stability, order-chaos
# Closed loops reverse engineering
## Functional units,  cortical structures
## small brains: insect brain, 3 layer NN
## owl hearing: coincident neurons
# test theories
# Neuromorphic computing outside neural science



!! Questions
Lateral Prefrontal Cortex volume lossing (simulating this?)

How is this related to von Neuman machine?
